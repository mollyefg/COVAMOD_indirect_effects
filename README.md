R scripts and files needed to run the simple model described in our preprint (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.07.20170456), along with a .pdf of the document.
main_script.R - the R script to run different vaccination scenarios for a single simple SEIR model with one age class. Requires put_fig_letter.R and schematic.jpg, and several packages. To run the script more quickly, you can change the vector 'v' from the fine-scale option to the coarse-scale option. The figure output from this script can be seen in '4panelresults.jpg'.
